## Getting Started

SnapLoop is a feature-rich social media application built using Flutter, Firebase, and Clean Architecture principles. Users can create posts, like, comment, view other users' profiles, and connect with each other in a clean and intuitive interface.
The app uses BLoC (Business Logic Component) for efficient and scalable state management, ensuring a clear separation between UI and logic. This enhances maintainability and makes it easier to add new features.
SnapLoop also supports persistent authentication, and seamless light/dark theme switching — delivering a modern user experience.
